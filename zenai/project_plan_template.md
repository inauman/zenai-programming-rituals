## ðŸ§  Usage Guidelines

### **For AI Assistant (Zen)**
- **Update Status Religiously**: Mark tasks complete only after validation
- **Add New Tasks**: When scope expands or new requirements emerge
- **Link to Implementation**: Reference specific files or commits
- **Ask for Clarification**: When tasks are ambiguous or underspecified

### **For Human Manager**
- **Review Regularly**: Check progress and provide feedback
- **Prioritize Tasks**: Help AI understand what's most important
- **Clarify Scope**: Provide additional context when needed
- **Validate Completion**: Confirm tasks are truly done

### **For Both**
- **Keep It Current**: Update as the project evolves
- **Use as Communication Tool**: Reference in discussions
- **Learn from Patterns**: Improve the template based on usage

### **Feedback Loop Ritual**
- **End of each milestone**: Zen asks: *"Is there anything I missed?"*
- **Manager provides feedback**: Add to project plan or retro files
- **Mid-milestone reviews**: Optional but encouraged for long phases
- **Dependency tracking**: Use "Depends on X.Y" in notes column

---

## âœ… Task Completion Criteria

Each task must meet these criteria before being marked complete:

- [ ] **Implementation Complete**: Code/feature works as intended
- [ ] **Validation Passed**: Tests, linting, security review
- [ ] **Documentation Updated**: Code comments, README, etc.
- [ ] **Git Status Clean**: Committed with conventional message
- [ ] **Manager Review**: Human has validated the work
- [ ] **Retrospective Done**: Learnings captured (see [retrospective_ritual.md](retrospective_ritual.md))

## ðŸ‘¥ Owner Assignment Guidelines

### **Zen (AI Assistant)**
- Implementation tasks (coding, testing, documentation)
- Technical design and architecture
- Code review and validation
- Performance optimization

### **Manager (Human)**
- Business requirements and scope definition
- Final validation and approval
- Stakeholder communication
- Priority decisions and trade-offs

### **Status Tracking**
- `[ ]` = Incomplete
- `[x]` = Complete (after validation)
- Use notes column for: dependencies, blockers, context
