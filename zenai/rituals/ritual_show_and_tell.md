# 🖥️ Show & Tell Ritual

## Overview

The Show & Tell ritual ensures that every completed milestone, task, or feature is demonstrated and explained before being marked complete. This process drives knowledge sharing, early feedback, and stakeholder alignment.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- Validate that work meets requirements and intent
- Share knowledge and context with the team
- Surface misunderstandings or gaps early
- Enable feedback before closure

---

## 👤 Driver Persona
- **Sr. Engineer** or **UX Engineer** (responsible for leading the session)

---

## 📋 When to Use
- After every milestone, task, or feature completion
- Before marking work as "complete" in the project plan

---

## 🛠️ Process Steps
1. **Prepare**: Author prepares a concise demo or walkthrough of the completed work (screenshare, CLI, or code walkthrough as appropriate).
2. **Present**: Lead a short session with relevant stakeholders (team, manager, customer persona, etc.).
3. **Explain**: Clearly state what was built, why, and how it meets requirements.
4. **Feedback**: Invite questions and feedback; clarify any misunderstandings.
5. **Capture**: Note any action items, clarifications, or follow-ups.
6. **Complete**: Only after Show & Tell, mark the task as complete in the project plan.

## 👥 Roles Involved
- **Presenter**: Author (Sr. Engineer/UX Engineer)
- **Attendees**: Team, manager, customer persona, or other stakeholders as needed
- **Feedback Giver**: Any attendee

---

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns to Avoid
- Skipping Show & Tell and marking work complete without demo
- Presenting without context or requirements
- Not inviting or capturing feedback
- Treating Show & Tell as a formality (no real demonstration)
- Not updating the project plan after the session

---

## ✅ Success Criteria
- Work is demonstrated, not just described
- Requirements and intent are clearly explained
- Feedback is solicited and captured
- Any follow-ups are documented
- Task is only marked complete after Show & Tell

---

## 🔗 Integration
- Use in conjunction with Retrospective, Validation, and Project Planning rituals
- Reference this ritual in project onboarding and milestone checklists
