# README-for-Nauman.md – How to Collaborate with Me (The Human)

This document helps AI agents (like Zen) understand how I think, how I work, and how to collaborate with me most effectively. It also helps me reflect on my own role in our partnership.

---

## 👤 About Me

- I’m a **technical product leader**, system thinker, and hands-on architect.
- I value **clarity, design discipline, and secure engineering**.
- I rely on Zen not just to “do” but to “think with me.”
- I learn continuously and improve our rituals with every sprint.

---

## ✅ What I Value

- **Clarity of thought** before code
- **Security-first mindset** even when not explicitly stated
- **Validating reality** (don’t hallucinate API behavior — check specs)
- **Structure and systems** (interfaces, folder layouts, layered abstractions)
- **Consistency and maintainability** in code and process
- **Pushback from Zen** when I’m suggesting something that violates best practices

---

## ⚠️ What Frustrates Me

- ❌ Guessing about API support, tool versions, or behavior
- ❌ Forgetting earlier context or expectations
- ❌ Skipping validation (e.g., `git status`, test pass)
- ❌ Sloppy or inconsistent folder structure
- ❌ Repetition of avoidable mistakes
- ❌ Over-implementation when only a design was needed
- ❌ Broken links in documentation (causes 404 errors)
- ❌ Technical documentation when stakeholder-ready content is needed
- ❌ Public exposure of detailed docs before they're ready

---

## 🧠 How I Think

- Top-down, interface-first
- Systems over functions, contracts over implementation
- Validate with small feedback loops
- Improve the process as much as the product
- I often start loose, but prefer structure as we go deeper

---

## 🛠️ My Working Style

- I prefer **milestone-based workflows** (see [milestone_00_role_alignment.md](milestone_00_role_alignment.md) and [milestone_0_sprint_planning.md](milestone_0_sprint_planning.md))
- I like **living documents** like [projectplan.md](projectplan.md) for tracking
- I welcome **well-structured prompts** (use [zen_prompt_framework.md](zen_prompt_framework.md))
- I’ll sometimes paste screenshots, notes, or half-formed thoughts — help me shape them
- I’ll forget things too — remind me gently or link back to our agreed structure

---

## 📣 How to Help Me More Effectively

- Ask:  
  > _“Is there anything I can help you clarify or refine before we proceed?”_

- Nudge me if:
  - I haven’t provided enough context
  - I’m skipping a design step
  - I’m pushing code too early

- Keep track of:
  - Our behavioral agreements in [.cursorrules](.cursorrules)
  - Our expectations in [cursor_expectations.md](cursor_expectations.md)
  - Any changes that need codification

---

## 🔁 Feedback Loop

At the end of each milestone or sprint:
- Zen should ask:
  > _“Would you like to give feedback for me (Zen), yourself (Nauman), or the process?”_

- Any learnings about my behavior go here, in this file
- We reflect, codify, and improve together
