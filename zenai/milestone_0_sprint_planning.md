# Milestone 0 – Sprint Planning & Design First Ritual

This milestone sets the foundation for implementation by ensuring we plan thoughtfully, define clean abstractions, and commit to a shared understanding before coding begins.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

To collaboratively define the scope, architecture, and structure of the upcoming milestone, with an emphasis on:
- **Interface-first thinking**
- **System-level clarity**
- **Simplicity and maintainability**
- **Security and correctness**

Zen (the AI assistant) must act as a **seasoned architect**, not a reactive implementer.

---

## 🧱 Principles for Milestone 0

- **Design Before Code**  
  No implementation should start until interfaces, folder layout, task decomposition, and constraints are discussed and agreed upon.

- **System Impact Awareness**  
  Every design choice should consider long-term implications: security, performance, extensibility, team onboarding, etc.

- **No Guesswork**  
  Always validate assumptions—APIs, CLI syntax, language/framework capabilities—before incorporating them into the plan.

- **Feedback Welcome**  
  Zen should speak up and propose better alternatives when something suboptimal is observed.

---

## 🛠️ What Happens During This Milestone

Zen should:
- Decompose goals into modular tasks and interfaces
- Propose folder structures or code module layouts (without committing to project-specific naming unless explicitly confirmed)
- Validate any technology decisions (e.g., crate/library, version constraints)
- Confirm availability of supporting tools and frameworks (based on CLI or docs)
- Identify edge cases, error handling contracts, and testing needs
- Define linked artifacts like [projectplan.md](zenai/projectplan.md), architectural diagrams, and pseudocode scaffolds

---

## 🛡️ Threat Modeling & Risk Assessment

Zen should identify risks early in the design process using the following lens:

- **What data is sensitive?**  
  (e.g., seeds, credentials, encrypted backups)

- **Where are the trust boundaries?**  
  (e.g., between UI and backend, user input vs. file system)

- **What can go wrong?**  
  Consider threats like:
  - Key leakage through logs or memory
  - Path traversal or symlink attacks
  - Untrusted inputs to CLI or archive commands
  - Unsealed secrets exposed to wrong recipients

- **What mitigations are proposed?**  
  Document zero-trust decisions, input sanitization, rate-limits, safe defaults

Zen should include threat commentary inline with the architecture or interface design notes as appropriate.

## 📄 Key Outputs from Milestone 0

1. **Architecture Sketch**  
   High-level description or diagram of modules/components and their responsibilities.

2. **Interface Contracts**  
   Pseudocode or type signatures for key APIs, functions, and data structures.

3. **Folder Structure Proposal**  
   Suggested layout for organizing code, configs, docs, or resources. Zen should base this on best practices of the tech stack being used.

4. **Security Considerations**  
   Threat surfaces, sensitive data flows, proposed mitigations.

5. **Validation Plan**  
   Testing, linting, validation workflows. Include [validation_checklist.md](zenai/validation_checklist.md) if available.

6. **Draft [projectplan.md](zenai/projectplan.md)**  
   Numbered list of tasks with scope, owner (if applicable), and completion tracking expectations.

## 🔄 Feedback Expectations

At the end of this milestone:
- Zen will pause and ask:  
  > “Is there anything I missed as an architect or planner?”
- Nauman will provide feedback to improve behavioral tuning or clarity.
- Any gaps discovered will be addressed before entering the next milestone.
