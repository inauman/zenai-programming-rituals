# ZenAI Programming Rituals 🧘‍♂️🤖

A practical, open-source framework for collaborating with AI development assistants (like Cursor, ChatGPT, or Claude) with clarity, structure, and discipline.

This system helps you:
- Think like an architect before you build
- Codify project planning and validation rituals
- Design first, code later — with security and sanity
- Evolve your AI workflows as a living engineering discipline

## 🎯 **3PAI Framework Philosophy**

ZenAI is built on the **3PAI philosophy** - four pillars that ensure effective AI-human collaboration:

- **🧠 People + AI**: Customer-centric collaboration and stakeholder alignment
- **⚙️ Process**: Efficient and effective ways to build trustworthy, secure, faster, cheaper, and highest quality products
- **🏗️ Platform**: Technology, tools, frameworks, and standards that enable success
- **🤖 AI**: Integrated throughout all pillars to enhance human capabilities
