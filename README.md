# ZenAI Programming Rituals 🧘‍♂️🤖

A practical, open-source framework for collaborating with AI development assistants (like Cursor, ChatGPT, or Claude) with clarity, structure, and discipline.

This system helps you:
- Think like an architect before you build
- Codify project planning and validation rituals
- Design first, code later — with security and sanity
- Evolve your AI workflows as a living engineering discipline

## 🎯 Why Use This?

If you're:
- Building serious projects using AI dev assistants
- Frustrated by guessy or chaotic AI behavior
- Tired of repeating instructions, context, and rules
- Looking for more rigor, architecture, and automation…

This framework gives you a repeatable, improvable way to work with AI — like a true teammate, not a code vending machine.

## 🧠 Core Principles

- Day 0 → Foundation & planning (roles, architecture, security)
- Security is default, not an add-on
- Customer-centric design with 360° perspective
- Prompting is programming — structure it like you would your codebase
- Feedback loops built into every phase (from AI → human and vice versa)

---

## 🛠️ Compatible With

- 🧠 Cursor
- 💬 ChatGPT / GPT-4
- 🤖 Claude / Anthropic
- 🧪 Any system that supports markdown rituals or AI planning flows
